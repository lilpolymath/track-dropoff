# Track Dropoff

This is my solution to the track dropoff question. It is written **in TypeScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** using [React](https://reactjs.org/) (frontend), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend).

## Getting Started

#### Install npm dependencies:

Install dependencies for the [`backend`](./backend). Open a terminal window and install the `backend`'s dependencies

```bash
cd backend
yarn install
```

Open a separate terminal window and navigate to the [`frontend`](./frontend) directory and install its dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
```

### Start the server (backend)

On the same terminal, run the following command to start the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server is now running at [`http://localhost:3001/`](http://localhost:3001/).

### Start the app (frontend)

On the terminal window used to install frontend npm dependencies, run the following command to start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore the UI.
